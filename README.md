# Client Project | Company: LuxuryElements
## LuxuryElements.com will be a fully functional website to showcase couture artist. Per interview with artist-client, the below outlines preferences and desires:
 * GOALS:
    - Showcase artist's pieces & collections
    - Promote artist couture brand
    - No prices; only artwork
 * END USER: 
    - Artist would like for end user to be able to view couture pieces via images & videos. 
    - Consumer should be easily directed to e-commerce partner site where pieces are exclusively available for direct purchase.
### MVP's | Extra Feature Requests | Phases

    - Collections & correlating pages
    - Connect/contact page
 * PHASE II: Extra Features
    - Special animated intro
