# Client Project | Company: LuxuryElements
## LuxuryElements.com will be a fully functional website to showcase couture artist. Per interview with artist-client, the below outlines preferences and desires:
    * GOALS:
        - Showcase artist's pieces & collections
        - Promote artist couture brand
        - No prices; only artwork
    * END USER: 
        - Artist would like for end user to be able to view couture pieces via images & videos. 
        - Consumer should be easily directed to e-commerce site where pieces are exclusively available for direct purchase.
### MVP's | Extra Feature Requests | Phases
    * PHASE I: Minimum Viables
        - About Me: to introduce artist
        - Luxury Elements: List of modes/ingredients used in artist's pieces; artist is branding herself on using only high quality earth elements and rare jewels.
        - Collections & correlating pages
        - Connect/contact page
      * PHASE II: Extra Features
        - NFT's: Artist would like to gift an NFT with every purchase. 
        - Will need to incorporate OpenSea profile, with directions for consumer in simple layman's terms.
