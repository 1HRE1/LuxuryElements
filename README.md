# Company: LuxuryElements
## Client Project: 
    - GOAL: Build LuxuryElements.com, a fully functional website to showcase artist's work and promote brand.
    - END USER: Artist would like for end user to be able to view pieces and collections, via images and videos. However, this website is only to showcase the artist and her wearable couture art pieces; all items are available exclusively on one e-commerce website for direct sale, so will need to link product pages of e-commerce website, to artist showcase website.
