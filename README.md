# Client Project | Company: LuxuryElements
## LuxuryElements.com will be a fully functional website to showcase couture artist. Per interview with artist-client, the below outlines preferences and desires:
 * GOALS:
    - Showcase artist's pieces & collections
    - Promote artist couture brand
    - No prices; only artwork
* END USER: 
    - Artist would like for end user to be able to view couture pieces via images & videos. 
    - Consumer should be easily directed to e-commerce site where pieces are<b>exclusively available for direct purchase.
### MVP's | Extra Feature Requests | Phases
* PHASE I: Minimum Viables
    - Home page/Luxury Elements: to introduce artist modes of art; artist is branding herself on using only high quality earth elements and rare jewels
    - About Me: to introduce artist/background
    - Collections & correlating pages
    - Connect/contact page
* PHASE II: Extra Features
    - NFT's: Artist would like to gift an NFT with every purchase. 
    - Will need to incorporate OpenSea profile, with directions for consumer in simple layman's terms.
